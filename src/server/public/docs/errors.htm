<p>All of these codes are API key relatedâ€¦ the key may no longer be valid, not exist, or already have a player in that room associated with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>100 - a player already exists with that API key. This error will be sent along with the snake that has that key. Often, this just means that your snake is already in that room. It could also mean that your key was leaked and another person is using it to make their own robots</li>
<li>101 - your API key is expired. If you ever get this error when making a bot, double check you received your key from the <a href="/developers">developer page</a>. If you did, reach out to the developers.</li>
<li>102 - your API key does not exist. Double check to see that you did not accidentally remove the key from the <a href="/developers">developer page</a>, or that your key matches the UID and vise versa.</li>
<li>103 - API key and UID mismatch. Once again, double check everything. Make sure you copied and pasted from the correct row on the <a href="/developers">developer page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="xx-codes-1">2XX codes</h2>
<ul>
<li>200 - Bad words failed to clean. this will only happen if your bot sends chat messages.</li>
</ul>
